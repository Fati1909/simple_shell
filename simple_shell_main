2 overview

The simple shell is a command that reads the lines of a file or terminal, interprets them and generally performs other commands. It is the program that is run when a user connects to the system. It integrates many features to facilitate interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretive language is common to interactive use and not interactive (shell scripts). In other words, commands can be typed directly into the single shell or can be placed into a file, which can be executed directly by the single shell.
